# Transformer-Model-for-Pseudocode-to-C-Conversion
This repository contains a Transformer-based model designed to convert pseudocode into C++ code. It utilizes a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with embedding layers, multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward layers to generate structured and executable C++ programs from logical pseudocode instructions
